## Personal - Master Next.js

I use this repository to host my official website and the APIs I build on the fly for personal use. Please refrain from cloining this repository as it might not suit your expectations (Trust me, there is a lot of clutter and code that you might never want to use).

### Looking for the UI code?

The website is built using Next.js and in case you want to use it, please visit the `praveentcom/personal-website-nextjs` repo and clone it. Please don't remove the attribute in the footer so that I can get proper credit. In case you don't want to attribute, get a permission via Twitter DM.
